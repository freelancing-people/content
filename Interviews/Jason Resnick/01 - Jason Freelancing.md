## What's your background/history?

I knew real early on that I wanted to work for myself. I remember specifically the moment when I said that "I would never work at a job I dreaded getting up in the morning for." That was when I was 14 years old working as a stock boy in a fabric store.

But of course, rarely does that happen from the start. In and after college, I worked for Fortune 100 companies as well as small agencies and consultant firms. I struck out on my own in the early 2000s when I was laid off from the company I was working for as they lost a ton of business when everything in the .com world fell apart. I thought then that I had a skill businesses needed and I could run my own business. I was sorely mistaken and after about 18 months I found myself looking for another full-time job. 

I did learn quite a lot during that time and knew that I would be back on my own again. This time to stay. That would happen in August of 2010 and I haven't looked back since.

Why/How did you get started with freelancing? OR How did you land your first contract which led you to start freelancing?

I started with freelancing because I saw it as a way to build my own business, working with the types of people I wanted to work with and an avenue to the flexbility I wanted for my life to be with family and friends when I wanted to.

How did you grow your business? After the first contract, what you did to get other contracts?

Word of mouth became something that I got good at. Sure, you can't control someone else and what they say to other people. But I always tried to exceed expectations and cater to the needs of clients. I try to provide them with so much value that when they hear someone talk about a need that I can potential solve, I want my name to be at the front of their minds.

As an introvert, networking is tough. However it's a must and making connections regularly to colleauges, businesses, even vendors is key to growing a business.

What was the first bad thing that happened to you which taught you the first lesson in running a consulting biz?

That's a tough one - I learned that running a service based business can be extremely liberating and restrictive all at the same time. One thing to remember is that you are running a business, not the other way around. Sure you have clients that you need to answer to, but you can't let them drive the ship. Know what it is that you do well and solve for them and don't deviate from that.

How are you sustaining this business for x years? What did you focus on for sustaining it in the long term?

My main focus is on my monthly clients. Building recurring revenue in my business has allowed me to build sustainability in my business. Moreso though, I focus on these clients because they are determined and invested on their businesses enough to continue to grow their businesses month over month.

Revenue statistics if you are willing to share and how it grew?

I don't normally talk about my numbers, it's nothing that I'm hiding, but it's just something that I don't really talk about. I have my pricing on my website that anyone can see and if you've followed me for some time, then you can figure a round about number of what I pull in. 

I will say though that I've spoken at great lengths about the process I went through that 10X'd my monthly revenue on several podcasts.

How did you go about your hiring strategy and what mistakes did you make?

I'm a solo business owner and do not have a team. I try to automate, optimize and scale what I need to first. After 7+ years in business, I still have yet to hire anyone.

Did you ever get too comfortable due to which you got distracted and your business had a downfall?

Being a business owner is an uncomfortable world. If you get comfortable, then you just have a hobby. 

With that being said, there are always ups and downs in business. Being able to identify when these downturns happen though and account for them will go a long way in building a sustainable businiess.

How do you charge your clients? The hourly basis or project costing? 

Monthly

How do you manage change requests? Do you consider them in your initial cost - what is your strategy in overall execution for change requests?

Although I rarely take the one-off project, change requests are the gateway into recurring revenue. Businesses will always have change requests.

If you don't have a process for tracking them and saying "Let's stay focused on what we set out to do first and then address this later on" stop everything and get one now.

You have a podcast and people see you as an expert in running a consulting business? How did you reach there?

I'm not a great writer, but I do write regularly. For me, having a podcast is a better medium for producing content. I enjoy helping, speaking, coaching, and building products for freelancers. Having a podcast allows for a wider reach to that audience in my opinion.

When I decided to focus in on ecommerce, specifically WooCommerce and WordPress, I was coming from the Ruby on Rails world. I was unknown in the WordPress community. So instead of traveling the world (because I didn't have the money for that) to attend conferences, and I wasn't really prepared to write about WordPress yet, I decided to start a podcast with a fellow WordPress developer and we would geek out on WordPress related topics and bring on guests. That got my name out in the WordPress space much faster than anything I could've ever written.

From that experience, it was only natural to move forward with Live in the Feast and help folks who are looking to jump into the freelance space or consulting space with the knowledge and experience I and others have.

I'm not sure I'm an expert, but I have been at this for a while and figured a few things out. So I'm a bit further down the road that many people are on and if I can help them avoid the bumps in the road, I'm happy to do it.

How is your overall experience today? Is it satisfying? How do you measure your success?

I love what I do! I'm able to be at home with my wife and son. I was able to be there when my son was born and take care of him all day long as soon as he was brought home from the hospital with my wife.

I look forward to seeing him take his first steps, first day of school, and grow into a young man.

My time spent with my family is how I measure success. Money comes and goes, but time is something you will never get back and that's always been my focus from the time I was 14.

What are your goals for the future and how do you intend to achieve them?

See previous question :). 

What advice would you give the freelancers who are struggling to achieve financial security and be truly independent?

I wrote a blog post answering this specific question and the 6 steps that I took to become independent and not have to sit at someone else's desk again.
