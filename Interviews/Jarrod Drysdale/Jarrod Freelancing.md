### What's your background/history?

My story starts back in college, when I was an electrical engineering major. I was sitting in Calc 2 class, and I hated it. 
I ended up quitting going to that class, which was abnormal for me because I was a good student, and realized I needed to 
make a change. I thought that as an engineer I’d get to create new things, but realized that most of the work was just 
fixing broken stuff, and not creating anything new.

I’d been designing websites for my rock band for fun, and I realized that was the kind of work I wanted to be doing, so I 
decided to switch majors to design. So i went into my engineering program advisor’s office and told him. He pointed at 
his desk that he was about to award scholarships to the top 5 engineering students, and I was one of them. “Are you sure you 
still want to change majors?” he said. “Yes.” He shook his head, and I left.

I’ve been a designer for around 12 years. I’ve worked at a variety of ad agencies in the US, from tiny boutique interactive 
firms up to one of the larger digital ad agencies in the world. About 6 years into my career, I read the book Getting Real, 
and decided I wanted to own my own business. So I found a freelance client and quit my job.

I’ve been freelancing and making my own products ever since.

### How did you get started with freelancing?

My turning point happened just after realizing how unhappy I was working for other people. Don’t get me wrong—I was lucky to 
have great jobs and coworkers for the first half of my career. I just realized that working at agencies, it would be years 
before I’d be given a chance to run projects the way I wanted to and to do the kind of design work I wanted to.

That all kind of culminated when I read Getting Real and started thinking about building my own business. That dream was 
just too much for me to pass up. I knew it was a huge risk, but I had to try. Surprisingly, it’s worked out pretty well!

### How did you grow your business? After the first contract, what you did to get other contracts?

My approach to freelancing might be a bit unusual because I use freelancing to fund my products business. Freelancing pays 
the bills and frees me up to do other work. So my goal for freelancing is to earn enough income to live, and then I cut it 
off. I fully realize how lucky and privileged I am to be able to say that!

But, I bring that up because my approach to creating products and the way I market my consulting services are similar, 
and they feed off one another.

Early on, my leads all came from former coworkers at agencies where I’d worked. Some had left for other jobs and and my 
former coworkers became my clients. In other cases, former coworkers were freelancing too, and we’d send each other leads 
when we were overbooked.

Early on, my network from working with other designers for years was a huge value to my freelancing business.

Later on, I started to find clients because of my products business. As I released more products, I saw more clients seeking 
me out because I’d built authority as a design expert. These days, I rarely have to go search for new clients—they come to 
me because I’ve built an audience and following over the years by releasing products, writing, and building up my visibility. 
I usually have more leads than I can accept because of this.

### What was the first bad thing that happened to you which taught the first lesson in working as a freelancer?

I had a client early on as a freelancer that just walked all over me the same way agency clients would. I was pretty upset 
about it, because I wanted to run my freelance business differently than the way agencies worked. I was tired of having to 
make changes to my designs I knew would make them worse, and I didn’t want to do things like create 3 separate visual designs 
for the same project. But this project took that same path and I didn’t know what to do about it.

So I found myself with a list of very specific instructions from the client: draw an icon of a certain object, design the 
logo using a specific font, etc.

And I realized I had a lot of learn about how to manage my clients and projects.

After that client relationship ended, I spent a lot of time learning to manage my clients and projects, and I used future 
clients as guinea pigs. I’d try different project structures, contracts, presentation methods, terminology, and all kinds 
of things trying to find ways to regain control over my projects. Eventually, after a lot of work, I found a process that 
worked for me.

### How are you sustaining this business for 6 years?

I’ve been running this business for 6 years. Over the years, I’ve shifted focus multiple times. Sometimes I’m more focused 
on products, and other times on freelancing. For the last 2.5 years, I’ve been successfully doing both at once. For me, 
the biggest win in terms of long term, consistent income has been moving clients onto retainer agreements. I’ve been doing 
that for 2 years now, and my income is less spiky and significantly more predictable.

### Revenue statistics if you are willing to share and how it grew?

I don’t share my total revenue publicly, but my freelancing business had made 6 digits gross income for the last 3 years. 
I am not trying to increase that revenue—I use it to pay myself a salary and work on my products business, which is my main 
focus for growth.

### Did you ever subcontract your work?

I never subcontract any work. I’ve done small experiments with it, with the client being aware, because I’d never hide that 
from a client. In my limited experiments, I found it's very difficult to find people who are reliable and deliver work on time. Anyone who is reliable tends to match my fees, and there’s no profit in hiring them. So, I do all the work myself.

On occasion, I refer a developer to build my designs, but they are employed directly by the client, not subcontracted.

### Did you ever get too comfortable due to which you got distracted and your business had a downfall?

I wouldn’t say my business has ever suffered because I got distracted. I’ve made intentional choices that unfortunately 
led to decreased revenue. For example, I chose to focus on a product and the product sales underperformed, and there was 
an opportunity cost because I gave up client work to do that. But, I tend to be pretty diligent and driven and I’ve never 
had an issue with slacking off—my problem is working too hard. ;)

### How do you charge your clients? The hourly basis or project costing? How do you manage change requests?

I quit working hourly less than a year of freelancing after I had clients try to negotiate rates, or ask me to spend fewer 
hours. Now, I do flat rates for every project.

My project fees are based on an effective hourly rate and an estimate of the hours I expect it to take. I’m pretty good at
planning projects after doing this for over a decade, so I rarely have an issue with under billing, which is the biggest 
risk to the freelancer. Also, anytime a scope change happens, I renegotiate the fee, deadline, and then ask for a new 
contract. I’ve been burned too many times by scope creep. New features = new contract and deadline. Always.

As for change requests, I build a revision cycle into every project and contract. My phrasing is that every project 
includes 1 round of minor revisions. This amounts to no more than half a day of work. Anything beyond that I bill at 
an hourly rate, but if the changes or additions are significant enough I just plan them as a new project.

### How is Critique playing the part in this overall journey and what are your goals for that?

My newsletter is primarily for my products business. I write for designers, not people who would be clients. However, I do 
have clients subscribed to my newsletter, and as I mentioned earlier, some of my biggest clients have found me because of 
my products business and my reputation as a design expert. So, not only is the newsletter a method of building up my 
audience and selling products, it’s also helped clients find me.

Dividing time between my consulting and products businesses is a constant challenge. Generally, because I work mostly 
on client retainers, I know how many days per month of client work I’ll do. I schedule that work at the beginning of 
each month, and work in my products business surrounding those deadlines.

### How is your overall experience today? Is it satisfying? How do you measure your success?

I’m really happy with my business right now. I have great clients, and my products business is doing well. I find the work 
satisfying, especially when I can see clients I’ve worked with for years benefiting from my work and seeing the success 
happen partially because of my contribution. The products business is very fulfilling because I get to teach other 
designers, see them apply what they learn, and improve and find new opportunities. I’m really grateful to be able to help 
as many people as I do.

For me, success is about 2 things:

1. Making enough money to live comfortably (I don’t care about being rich, but I’m not willing to starve for my art)
2. Having the freedom to do the work I believe in.

I’ve met those criteria for years, and I’m really grateful for that.

### What are your goals for the future and how do you intend to achieve them?

My goal all along has been to grow my products business. I’ve had both successes and failures, and I know that success 
is about continuing to show up, ship great work, and tell people about it.

Specifically, I’ve taken an honest look at my efforts for the past few years, and looked at the data. I’m cutting 
strategies and efforts that aren’t making me money or helping people (busy work like starting a podcast, maintaining 
old projects, etc), and doubling down on the ones that have worked (marketing approaches like writing and my newsletter). 
I’ve started this all within the last couple of months, so we’ll see what happens! :)

### What is one thing that you would do differently if you start again?

Do I sound horribly arrogant if I say I wouldn’t change a thing? I haven’t done anything perfectly, but I’ve learned from 
my mistakes and adapted. I don’t think there’s anything else I could have done!

### Have you found anything particularly helpful or advantageous in your freelancing journey?

Being a generalist has been a huge benefit for my freelancing business. I can do design, front-end coding, copywriting, 
and marketing strategy. For many projects, I’m a one-stop shop. And my clients love that they can just bring something 
to me and know I’ll take care of every aspect. It sets me up as a problem solver and not just a designer for hire. That 
gives me more control over my projects, but it’s also more profitable because there’s always a good reason to hire me!

### What advice would you give the freelancers who are struggling to achieve financial security and be truly independent?

Freelancing is hard, and earning your independence is even harder. Here’s my advice:

1. Build yourself up as an expert.

Stop looking at yourself as an hourly worker or a designer/developer/whatever for hire. You need to build up expertise and 
solidify your process so that when you begin projects, people are listening to you and following your advice rather than 
telling you what to do.

Building up a public presence helps with this: writing articles on design blogs, being active in the design community, 
and doing things other people respect and appreciate.

For example, I’m a designer, and I’ve been teaching design for years. I’ve written 4 books, hundreds of articles, and I 
now run a design course over at Proximity School of Design. All of these efforts have boosted my freelancing business in 
major ways.

But I didn’t start out as a guru or some famous designer. I just got out there and shared my experiences and taught what 
I knew. Eventually, people started to trust me because my articles or newsletter helped them.

This built me up as an expert both to other designers and to potential clients. It’s a lot of work and it doesn’t happen 
overnight, because earning peoples’ trust takes time. But getting trust is how you can earn your financial security and 
creative freedom. No one will just trust you because you ask them to. You have to earn it!

2. Be reliable.

Many of the freelancers who I’ve personally seen struggling just aren’t reliable. Their estimated fees are always wrong. 
They always deliver work late. They disappear and don’t keep the client involved and informed. They deliver buggy or 
incomplete work. They tack on surprise fees.

If you do those things, you’re not going to be successful and independent. Success starts with being great at what you do, 
and that means NEVER delivering work late, missing details, or doing a bad job.

Most freelancers blame these issues on the client. But if you let the client walk all over you and wreck your process, 
you either shouldn’t have worked with the client (it’s not a good fit), or, more likely, you just let them get away with it. 
The latter case is what happened to me, and I chose to learn how to fix it. If you want stability, you need to learn how 
to run your projects smoothly and do what you say you will!

3. Communicate the real value of your services.

You don’t just make pretty picture or write code (or whatever you do). Your work should be connected to something your 
client wants—usually more profit. To get the best clients and charge higher rates, you have to show how your work is 
valuable to the client. Most designers, for example, give generic justifications for their work like “We’ll make something 
fresh” or  “We’ll differentiate your brand.” But the client wants more customers. Help them get more customers, and they 
will pay you heaps of money and follow your advice!


4. Get off the client treadmill and start working with clients for the long term.

I wrote an article about working with clients over the long term at A List Apart  and here’s my article on retainers  
If you work with your best clients repeatedly, you don’t have to find new leads and clients, and your income become more 
solid. There are so many benefits to running your business this way!
