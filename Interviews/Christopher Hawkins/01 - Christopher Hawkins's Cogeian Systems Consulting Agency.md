### What's your background/history?

After dropping out of college to start a debt-collection business, I became interested in using computerized tools to help manage cases and aid with sales calls. I had been a computer enthusiast since age 8, but never thought there was any potential for earning a living with them prior to my experience co-owning a collection agency. After that business folded, leaving me with a large debt to pay off, I worked a series of temporary jobs - administrative assistant, security guard, telemarketer, jewelry salesman - as I considered my next move. Part of me wanted to return to school and finish my education, but the larger part of me wanted to start a new business.

By chance, I landed a job that allowed me to use my computer skill and put me in a position to learn how to really develop software. I left that job after a couple of years, started another business, failed again, and landed a real software development job with an HR software firm in Santa Barbara, CA.

### Why/How did you get started with Cogeian Systems? OR How did you land your first contract which led you to start Cogeian Systems?

In 2003, the software company I worked for was experiencing financial difficulties and began laying off employees. I survived the first two waves of layoffs, but was let go in the third. The timing of this was particularly bad - I had just bought a home and a new car for my growing family, and was very cash-poor at the moment. Immediately, I got on the phone and started reaching out to everyone I knew, but in 2003 *every* software company was struggling, and nobody was hiring. 

The best I managed was to capture some contract jobs - primarily "fix-it" work. At first I didn't want to continue contracting, but with no regular jobs to be had, and with contract work continuing to come my way, eventually I accepted it and began to actively pursue freelance and consulting work.

### How did you grow your company? After the first contract, what you did to get other contracts?

At the time, finding work was very difficult. I had recently relocated and had few connections in my new area. I found myself constantly seeking people out in the business community, constantly introducing myself to new people, constantly trying to put myself in a position to be noticed and accepted as part of the business community. It was exhausting and I didn't enjoy it, but doing so helped me to create a pipeline of business that was more or less self-replenishing.

### What was the first bad thing that happened to you which taught you the first lesson in running a consulting biz?

The first time I delivered work before receiving payment, and the client saw a chance to take advantage and not pay. They agreed that the work was of good quality and in conformance with the spec...they simply refused to pay! They knew that I was new to the business and had little recourse. I changed *everything* about how I approached client work after that.

### How are you sustaining this business for 12 years? What did you focus on for sustaining it in the long term?

14 years. Sometimes it feels as though the business has sustained itself! For a number of years, I was actively resisting allowing it to grow. That may or may not have been the right decision, but I've found that simply being active in the local business community and taking time to befriend my fellow business owner has been enough to ensure that enough work comes in the door. I've never purchased advertising of any kind, never mounted any significant marketing campaigns. I sent out a couple of mailers, but those never yielded any work. Blogging never yielded any work. None of the online marketing that we're told we're "supposed" to do ever yielded any work. Only referrals, relationships and SEO fundamentals ever resulted in work. Talking to the thousands of freelancers on my mailing list, or who listen to my podcast, it appears that _this is by far the norm_ - the freelancers who are able to make online marketing channels yield work for them are the extreme minority.

### Revenue statistics if you are willing to share and how it grew?

I don't share my revenue numbers, but I can tell you I've taken home 6 figures every year for 11 of the past 14 years.

### How did you go about your hiring strategy and what mistakes did you make?

The idea of doing a traditional hiring cycle has always been extraordinarily stressful for me. My primary strategy for hiring has always been to hire former colleagues from my corporate jobs, whose work I knew and trusted, or to hire people that those people recommended. Only once have I ever issued an open call for resumes, and it was a disaster. I'd rather shut down my business then deal with that, ever again.

### Did you ever get too comfortable due to which you got distracted and your business had a downfall?

Yes. In 2012, I began to feel as though I was missing out on the Saas explosion that was going on, and decided to launch a software product of my own. I put my consulting practice on auto-pilot and began to try to turn myself into a startup founder, absorbing every bit of information I could regarding how to conceive and launch a software product. I learned a lot, but the main lessons I learned were that:

a) most of the startup marketing advice out there is useless, and 
b) it's not a good idea to completely ignore your consulting practice the moment you decide to launch a product. 

I was careless and over-eager, and I damaged my consulting practice as a result, without ever managing to launch a product. I didn't give up on my product aspirations until early 2016. Those entire 4 years were wasted, leaving me bitter toward the startup world and with a broken consulting business. It was a bad, bad time.

I spent most of 2016 breathing new life into my consulting practice. If I had to do it all over again, I never would have taken that detour into the startup world. But there's no changing the past - my focus is firmly on making the best of the future.

### How do you charge your clients? Hourly basis or project costing?

Both, depending upon the relative trustworthiness of the client, and the scope & type of project requirements - certain engagements that fit into a particular fixed-scope criteria can be billed as a flat-rate item, while others can be billed as ongoing hourly work.

### How do you manage change requests?

Very carefully! First, the request is evaluated. Then, an impact statement and estimate revision is issued for the change request. If the client agrees to the impact and the cost, then we queue the changes up to be done whenever it makes the most sense to do so.

### Do you consider them in your initial cost - what is your strategy in overall execution for change requests?

At the start of a project, it's not unusual for my office to inform the client that it's wise to have a contingency fund of about 20% the total project cost. We never **plan** to bill that extra 20% - in fact, our focus is explicitly on bringing a project in on-budget, every time - but experience has taught me that, just as with real-world construction projects such as home renovations, it's wise to have coverage for things that could not be forseen at the outset of a project (like the sudden desire for a new feature).


### You have a podcast and people see you as an expert in running a consulting business? How did you reach there?

I've been blogging about freelancing and consulting issues since very early in my career. By the time I had a 14-year run of operating a consulting practice, it occurred to me that I could perhaps add value to the businesses of other freelancers. I've found that the mere act of sharing your experience can cause you to be seen as an expert. 

With this in mind, I launched $100K Freelancing (100kfreelancing.com), a show that helps freelancers and consultants learn the best practices for leveling-up and breaking through teh $100K revenue mark. Many of my listeners have some clients and do make some money, but feel as thought they're ready to ascend to a higher level in their operations, and I try to educate them how to do that, with the help of my co-hosts. Right now the show is offering a free piece of education entitled "[5 Client Situations Stopping You From Earning $100K](http://www.100kfreelancing.com/5-client-problems-stopping-earning-100k/)", and I invite any reader who wants to improve their business to sign up for it; it's a fantastic free resource.

### How is your overall experience today? Is it satisfying? How do you measure your success?

Over the years, the way I measure success has changed. As a young man (I started my consulting practice at age 30) my *sole* measure of success was money. If I made more than a certain amount, I felt successful. If I earned more than last year, I felt successful, If I earned less than last year, I felt as though I had failed.

Now, 14 years later, my perspective has changed. The years I spent trying to be a startup founder opened my eyes to how thankless I had previously been about my consulting business. I still like to earn well, but now quality-of-life factors are much, much more important to me than earning more than some particular benchmark figure is.

### What are your goals for the future and how do you intend to achieve them?

My goals for the future are to earn a living by helping as many freelancers and consultants to improve their businesses as I can. I do have a couple of coaching students and I am working on a new book for freelancers, but in the long-term I'm not sure what form the help I give will take. The podcast is one form, my articles are another, but I feel like I have more and better to offer my fellow freelancers, and I'll be investing some of my time into that as I move forward.
