### What's your background/history?

My first paid work was a Saturday job as a electrican's mate. Possibly as a result, I did Electronic & Electrical Engineering at university where the computer software parts of the course piqued my interest. I've worked for a variety of companies doing embedded software, Windows and Unix GUI apps and then I moved into writing web software.

### Why/How did you get started with Nineteen Feet? OR How did you land your first contract which led you to start Nineteen Feet?

While working at my last place, I was asked by a friend to produce some software for his new business. I was working for a small web agency as a project manager and was beginning to feel like it was time to move on. When my friend's business started taking off and he was able to order more time from me, I took the plunge and started Nineteen Feet with a project in my back-pocked so to speak.

### How did you grow your company? After the first contract, what you did to get other contracts?

Nineteen Feet is a projects based company rather than contract based. This is, the company delivers projects to its clients rather than hires out my time to work on your code base. All the projects that I do are via referrals, either from people that I've worked with in the past or because of my visibility in the Open Source PHP community. I work quite hard to ensure that the wider PHP development community knows who I am by contributing to Open Source projects and writing on my blog at [akrabat.com](https://akrabat.com).


### What was the first bad thing that happened to you which taught you the first lesson in running a consulting biz?

I've been very fortunate so far I think! I've had one client go bust owing me money which was a nuisance, but not crippling. The biggest thing that I've learnt is that there isn't as much time available for working as you would believe and setting customer expectations based on the reality of your work load is vital.

### How are you sustaining this business for this long time? What did you focus on for sustaining it in the long term?

As I work mostly in the Enterprise space, I'm working on transitioning my clients to more long term support contracts for installed applications which will provide a base income for the company. I'm not currently looking to grow Nineteen Feet into a large conglomerate, so I can let it grow at a slow, manageable rate.

### Revenue statistics if you are willing to share and how it grew?

Nineteen Feet's growth is a linear line that's mostly constrained by how much I want to work. To increase its growth, I would have to take on people and then do active marketing which isn't what I'm looking to do at the moment. Each year, it makes a little more than the previous year and as a services business, nearly all the money it makes is profit. We're entirely bootstrapped and we save for the upcoming tax and VAT bills as each invoice is paid to ensure that there's no surprises.

### How did you go about your hiring strategy and what mistakes did you make? OR Are you independent and remain to be that way?

I want to enjoy my life and at the moment, managing people and marketing my business are not high priorities. I see work as a means to an end and not the end in and of itself. Ninteen Feet's current state allows me to enjoy my life outside of the business.

Who knows what will happen in the future though when the kids have left home?!


### Did you ever get too comfortable due to which you got distracted and your business had a downfall?

No. I keep an eye on the business' health at least once per month.

### How do you charge your clients? Hourly basis or project costing?

### How do you manage change requests? Do you consider them in your initial cost - what is your strategy in overall execution for change requests?

### You have a blog and people see you as an expert in PHP? How did you reach there?

I've had a blog forever - well a really long time! I use it to help people and also write down things that I've learned that I don't want to have to re-learn. It's hard to keep everything in your head, so my blog is my external memory store. I think that it's best to write with the express intention of helping people rather than for "status" or "marketing" - it's more genuine and I think this shows in the writing. Nothing replaces long-term hard work and I've been writing about development on [akrabat.com](akrabat.com) since 2006, so I think that helps.

In general, the blog along with speaking at PHP user groups and conferences helps the business as I get referrals. However, I treat this as separate in my mind from Nineteen Feet as "akrabat" is my hobby, not my day-job.

### How do you manage time to run your business and be updated with the latest updates in development workflows, technology, etc?

As I've alluded to, technology is my hobby as well as my work, so I play with tech outside of work time. Nineteen Feet doesn't take up all my time each week as I want to do my hobbies too. I don't formally split my time, but it's not uncommon for me to start Nineteen Feet work at 11am as I've been working on an OSS project such as Slim Framework or a personal OpenWhisk one, answering Stack Overflow or writing a blog post before that.

### How is your overall experience today? Is it satisfying? How do you measure your success?

I'm really enjoying myself. I measure my success by having enough money in the bank to live while not working too long or having to work on things I don't want to do. By this measure Nineteen Feet is doing very well. 

### Was the business leap worth it?

Definitely!

### What are your goals for the future and how do you intend to achieve them?

My long term goal is to expand my projects to use different languages and technologies to keep relevant and also to ensure that the work is interesting.

### What advice would you give the freelancers who are struggling to achieve financial security and be truly independent?

Now that's a question! I don't really know. The number of working days in a year is fewer than people realise. I think it helps to work out how many working days you actually have, taking into account illness, looking for work, holidays, etc. and then set your rates appropriately. I have found it helpful to save my tax liabilities as I go and to save as much additional as I can, so that the company has a buffer. I also like to regularly review the company's financial position to keep track of trends so that I can correct if necessary.
